Bentley, who founded Bentley Motors in 1919, to the current team of over 4,000 dedicated employees, the company’s extraordinary cars have always been designed and built by exceptional people using only the finest of materials. They have always been driven by exceptional people, too. From the passionate Bentley Boys and Girls who raced the cars in the 1920s, encouraging W.O. Bentley to achieve ever greater feats of engineering, to the visionary Bentley owners of today, Bentley drivers help to shape the world around them.\\n\\nAs a brand we are also constantly looking forwards, and in this section you will find our technological innovations and future vision for Bentley. And now we are going further, towards a more sustainable future. In 2020 Bentley Motors launched the ‘Beyond100’ Manifesto, which outlines our intention to become the most sustainable luxury Automotive brand in the world.\\n\\nThe unique relationship between those who create the cars and those who drive them has helped create an enthralling story unlike any other. Explore the stories below to find out more.\\n\\nW.O Bentley\\n\\nBorn in 1888 as the youngest of nine siblings, Walter Owen Bentley – though he preferred to be called W.O. – founded the company that carries his name on 10 July 1919. Now, almost 100 years later, his name is known across the globe for creating cars with an unrivalled blend of performance and the finest craftsmanship and materials. Below, we take a look at the man who changed motoring forever.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nBentley Boys and Girls\\n\\nBentley Boys - Always ready for a race, a challenge or a glass of champagne, the first generation of Bentley Boys were a close-knit group of extraordinary playboys, racers and adventurers who achieved global fame during the 1920s and 30s. They inspired a whole generation of Bentley drivers and admirers, with their passion for driving and deep love of a challenge. And behind the wheel of Bentley motorcars, they dominated Le Mans with five wins in just eight years.\\n\\nBentley Girls - The Bentley Boys may have set the pace, but Bentley Girls refused to take a back seat, making their mark in inimitable Bentley Style. Mary Petre Bruce, Dorothy Paget and Diana Barnato – Bentley’s Flying Lady – each played an extraordinary part in building the Bentley legend.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nBentley Story\\n\\nMotorsports\\n\\nMotorsport has been at the heart of Bentley throughout its 102 years. In 1921, just two years after the first Bentley prototype was revealed, it was racing at the world famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. Today, Bentley races with the Continental GT3, it’s most dynamic and powerful race car based on its most advanced road car yet. Designed by Bentley at its headquarters in Crewe, the Continental GT3 is raced by the luxury brand’s successful and prestigious teams around the world.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nBentley Brooklands\\n\\nFirst produced in 1993, 2007 saw the triumphant return of the Bentley Brooklands. Descended from an incomparable bloodline of truly potent coupés and taking power to a new level, the Bentley Brooklands featured the most powerful V8 engine Bentley had ever created, capable of top speeds of 184mph (296km/h).\\n\\nexplore bentley pre-owned\\n\\nContinental\\n\\nEarly in the 21st century, a stunning, two-door Bentley was unveiled, one that refined and redefined the language of grand tourer design. The revolutionary Continental GT has combined phenomenal performance and exquisite craftsmanship for more than a decade, with continual enhancements pushing the boundaries of technology, from sheer power to the choice of finishes.\\n\\nThis modern classic has been giving rise to countless Continental stories since the day it was launched. From four-time world rally champion Juha Kankkunen breaking the world ice speed record in a Continental GT Convertible to pop art legend Peter Blake creating a unique exterior for a Continental GT V8 S, this is a car that continues to inspire.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nFlying Spur\\n\\nThe Bentley Flying Spur was created to be a superlative four door sedan - for drivers and passengers alike. With enough space for four adults to travel in extraordinary comfort, the Flying Spur offered surging power combined with agility. Its acceleration, handling and all-wheel drive capability all contributed to an exceptional drive experience, taking both performance and luxurious interior craftsmanship to a new level.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nMulsanne\\n\\nThe Bentley Mulsanne spent a decade as the flagship model of the Bentley range. The world’s finest handmade car represents the ultimate combination of both luxury and performance. The range offered a choice of two remarkable vehicles: the Mulsanne; and the Mulsanne Speed for more dynamic driving. The Mulsanne was given a face lift in 2014, with new design cues and interior options, and a new derivatives joined the Mulsanne range: Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase offering extra legroom and comfort.\\n\\nexplore\\n\\nBentayga\\n\\nBentayga is the first Bentley SUV - also the world's first true luxury SUV. Launched in 2015, Bentayga was named after the Roque Bentayga, on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain, and was designed, engineered and crafted to offer unprecedented levels of refinement and performance.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/bentley-hybrids.html'}, page_content='The Bentley Hybrid Range\\n\\nThe key components\\n\\nThe Bentley range currently offers two proven systems of hybrid technology – one created for the Bentayga and the other for the Flying Spur. By combining efficient petrol engines with advanced electric motors, they offer the engaging drive and long range associated with Bentley’s petrol-only engines, alongside significantly lower emissions. This is hybrid technology without compromise.\\n\\nAll hybrid Bentaygas are fitted with a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 petrol engine, while hybrid Flying Spurs feature a 2.9 litre turbocharged V6 petrol engine. The battery and essential architecture of the hybrid system are the same.\\n\\nHoused between the gearbox and the petrol engine, the E Motor (a permanent magnet synchronous motor) delivers full torque instantly, minimising any delay that could result from turbocharger lag. The result is smooth, silent acceleration from a standing start – and the sense of effortless power for which all Bentleys are renowned.\\n\\nAll cars are powered by a 18.0 kWh (usable) lithium ion battery that can be charged at a rate of 7.2kW/h, meaning it can be fully recharged in as little as two and a half hours, depending on the charging infrastructure available. Cars include all cables required in the country of delivery as standard, however you can also request a Bentley Charging Dock for neatly storing the cables and charge unit.\\n\\nPlease note that installation of the Charging Dock is not included.\\n\\nKeep me informed\\n\\nPerformance without compromise\\n\\nIn the Bentayga, the E Motor is partnered with a 3.0 litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine, delivering 456 bhp (462PS) and 516 lb.ft (700 Nm) of torque for a top speed of 158 mph (254 km/h). The vehicle can travel at speeds of up to 84 mph (135 km/h) on electric power alone. Bentaygas equipped with this powertrain can achieve a combined range of 536 miles (863 km). They can drive for at least 28 miles (45km) in EV Drive mode (WLTP), a significant increase compared to the previous model.\\n\\nThe Flying Spur teams an E Motor with a 2.9-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine, delivering 536 bhp (544 PS) and 750 Nm (553 lb.ft) of torque, for a top speed of 177 mph (285 km/h) and the ability to reach 87 mph (140 km/h) on purely electric power. As a result, it can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a phenomenal 4.1 seconds (0-100 km/h in 4.3 secs). Combined range is 497 miles (800 km), while electric-only range is 25 miles (40km) (NEDC).\\n\\nThe key benefit, however, is efficiency. In a test in January 2022, nine Flying Spur Hybrids covered 10,500 miles (6,524 km) over six days, of which 3,000 miles (1,864 km) were driven on electric power alone – equivalent to driving across the United States from coast to coast. When compared to the Flying Spur V8, each car saved three gallons of fuel per day.\\n\\nSmart pedals for smarter driving\\n\\nA key element of the interface between the driver and the car is the haptic feedback provided via the brake and accelerator pedals.\\n\\nBentley Hybrid Efficiency Braking is a combination of two braking methods: traditional hydraulic braking to slow down the wheels and electric braking of the E Motor. The system cleverly blends the two, providing the driver with a conventional braking sensation through the brake pedal, while the vehicle harvests energy from the hydraulic brakes to recharge the battery.\\n\\nIn the Bentayga, the system provides further feedback to the driver, in the form of a pressure point experienced on depressing the accelerator pedal that indicates a change of power source, from electric-only to hybrid power.\\n\\nIf the car’s intelligent navigation system is active, the pedal will vibrate when you approach a junction or a change in the speed limit, instructing you to slow down. This conserves energy, while also providing a further opportunity for the system to recoup charge for the battery.\\n\\nKeep me informed\\n\\nA wealth of in-car information\\n\\nBentley hybrids can deliver a raft of information to the driver via the car’s infotainment system. The infotainment screen itself can display energy flow in each of the three driving modes, showing you whether the car is being powered by the battery or the petrol engine – or, if it is in Hold mode, if energy is flowing back to the battery to charge it.\\n\\nThe tachometer has been designed to augment the usual engine speed indication with additional information about the status of the battery and electric motor. At a glance, it can tell you what which mode you are in, whether the car is running on electric power or not and whether the petrol engine is running and if so, how fast. It will also tell you how much battery charge remains, how much fuel is in the tank and the vehicle’s remaining range at that moment.\\n\\nThe Bentley Hybrid Efficiency Navigation system features free text, context-specific search entry, which can respond to an address or point of interest. Navigation is improved with a three-dimensional building display, satellite maps and content in the head-up display, which also projects traffic information, street names and the distance to your destination.\\n\\nKeep me informed\\n\\nAll vehicles on this page: WLTP drive cycle: fuel consumption, mpg (l/100 km) – Combined 18.8-94.2 (3-15).
